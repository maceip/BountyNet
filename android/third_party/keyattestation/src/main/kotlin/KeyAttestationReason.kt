/** Reasons why a certificate chain could not be verified which are specific to key attestation. */

enum class KeyAttestationReason : CertPathValidatorException.Reason {
  // Certificate chain contains a certificate after the target certificate.
  // This likely indicates that an attacker is trying to get the verifier to
  // accept an attacker-controlled key.
  CHAIN_EXTENDED_FOR_KEY,
  // The key description is missing from the expected certificate.
  // An Android key attestation chain without a key description is malformed.
  TARGET_MISSING_ATTESTATION_EXTENSION,
  // Certificate chain contains a certificate other than the target certificate with an attestation
  // extension. This likely indicates that an attacker is trying to manipulate the key and
  // device properties.
  CHAIN_EXTENDED_WITH_FAKE_ATTESTATION_EXTENSION,
  // The origin violated the constraint provided in [ConstraintConfig].
  // Using the default config, this means the key was not generated, so the verifier cannot know
  // that the key has always been in the secure environment.
  KEY_ORIGIN_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION,
  // The security level violated the constraint provided in [ConstraintConfig].
  // Using the default config, this means the attestation and the KeyMint security levels do not
  // match, which likely indicates that the attestation was generated in software and so cannot be
  // trusted.
  SECURITY_LEVEL_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION,
  // The root of trust violated the constraint provided in [ConstraintConfig].
  // Using the default config, this means the key description is missing the root of trust, and an
  // Android key attestation chain without a root of trust is malformed.
  ROOT_OF_TRUST_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION,
  // The authorization list ordering violated the constraint provided in
  // [ConstraintConfig].
  AUTHORIZATION_LIST_ORDERING_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION,
  // There was an error parsing the key description and an unknown tag number was encountered.
